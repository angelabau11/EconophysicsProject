## Agent-Based Model of Social Mobility and Inequality

This project implements an agent-based model using object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python to explore the relationship between social mobility and economic inequality in a heterogeneous society. The model simulates a population of agents with diverse characteristics—such as education and productivity—and examines how these differences evolve through economic interactions.

In real societies, individuals are not homogeneous; they vary in attributes and opportunities. This project models such a society to analyze:

- **How inequality emerges naturally from agent interactions.**

- **The inverse relationship between inequality and social mobility.**

- **The impact of interaction types on income and productivity distribution.**

# Features

- **Heterogeneous agents: Each agent has unique traits (e.g., education level, productivity, resource access).**

- **Social class dynamics: Agents are grouped into social classes with the ability to move up or down depending on economic success.**

- **Interaction mechanisms: Includes various economic exchanges such as consumption, hiring, and investment (e.g., “broke-sale” function).**

- **Wealth and status updates: Agent wealth and employment status change over time based on outcomes of interactions.**
